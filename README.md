# Polydex
Polydex is a mod allowing you to see player-friendly information about 
blocks and items on servers. It designed for survival-like, vanilla client 
compatible servers using [Polymer](https://github.com/Patbox/polymer/) mods 
or [PolyMC](https://github.com/TheEpicBlock/PolyMc), through it can be used 
in modded or vanilla-content setting!

It can display tooltip (as a bossbar or sidebar) with basic information 
about targeted block or entity similarly to mods like WTHIT/HWYLA/WAILA.

It also adds simple way of checking recipes of items with chest gui interface
inspired by mods like Roughly Enough Items / Just Enough Items.

It's configurable and bundles some api, so other mods can be compatible with it
